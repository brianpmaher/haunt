# Haunt Game Engine

Haunt is a game engine I'm developing for the kinds of games I want to make and how I want to make them. More info to come...

## Development

All scripts should be run from the project root directory.

Scripts for each host platform are location within `scripts/<platform>`. For example, Windows scripts are all within `scripts\windows`.

### Windows

To setup the project for the first time, or after changes have been made, run `scripts\windows\setup.bat` from a cmd terminal.

#### Scripts

- `setup.bat` - Setup the project and all of its dependencies
- `build-all.bat` - Build the engine and editor
- `build-engine.bat` - Build the engine
- `build-engine.bat` - Build the editor

### Linux

### MacOS

## Platforms

Windows is the only officially supported target platform at the moment.

Haunt is intended to be a cross-platform engine, so Linux, MacOS, iOS, and Android support are all planned for future releases.
