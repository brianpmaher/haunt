# Attribution

Much of this project wouldn't be possible without things I've learned and used from programmers greater than myself.

Below are a list of attributions for code and papers used either directly or modified in this project.

## Project setup

Core project structure is based on [Travis Vroman's](https://travisvroman.com/) [Kohi Engine](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi) which is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi/blob/main/LICENSE). Travis teaches game engine design and development on his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj).

## Math

Much of the math types and functions were taken and modified from [Handmade Math](https://github.com/HandmadeMath/HandmadeMath). Handmade Math is licensed under [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal](https://github.com/HandmadeMath/HandmadeMath/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Converting a Rotation Matrix to a Quaternion

The function for determining a quaternion from a 4x4 matrix was adapted from: [Converting a Rotation Matrix to a Quaternion](https://d3cw3dd2w32x2b.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/matrix-to-quat.pdf) by [Mike Day](mday@insomniacgames.com) at Insomniac Games.

### A Faster Quaternion Vector Multiplication

The function for rotating a vector by a quaternion was adapted from: [A Faster Quaternion Vector Multiplication](https://blog.molecular-matters.com/2013/05/24/a-faster-quaternion-vector-multiplication/). The blog lists all source code as licensed under [The MIT License](https://blog.molecular-matters.com/source-code-license/). Credit to the original algorithm goes to [Fabian Giesen](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/) (ryg of Farbrausch fame), who posted this to the [Molly Rocket](https://mollyrocket.com/) forums years ago.

## Font and Logo

The font is [Scary Momster from 1001fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/scary-momster-font.html#license) and is available under a free license for non-commercial use, which this project falls under. The logo for the Haunt Engine is created using the Scary Momster font.
